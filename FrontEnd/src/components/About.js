            Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used
            in laying out print, graphic or web designs. The passage is
            attributed to an unknown <br/> <br/> typesetter in the 15th century who is
            thought to have scrambled parts of Cicero's De Finibus Bonorum et
            Malorum for use in a type specimen book.<br/> <br/> It usually begins with:
            “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do
            eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.”<br/> <br/> The
            purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text
            (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) <br/> <br/> that doesn't distract from the
            layout. A practice not without controversy, laying out pages with
            meaningless filler text can be very useful when the focus is meant
            to be on design, not content. The passage experienced a surge in
            popularity during the 1960s when Letraset used it on their
            dry-transfer sheets, and again during the 90s as desktop publishers
            bundled the text with their software.
